## Testimonial From Ezaz

During my first year at the institute, I was given a project based on c++ program. The project was to build a library managemnet system with some complex features. Currently I'm not bad at code but at that time I was learning how to code. That it is why it was a difficult task for me to make it alone. I utilized my precious time and made it, till my approach and at the end I messed up. Mr.Huzaifa a great friend and a great mentor helped me to get through this. He helped me to complete this project and it was submitted before deadline. No doubt he is good programmer with a skill to do and understand code.
